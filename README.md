## Hi there, I'm Delfina ðŸ‘‹

I'm a third-year student at UADE with a strong passion for technology and continuous learning. As an aspiring developer, I'm diving into various programming languages and frameworks to discover where I can make the most impact in the tech world. I'm enthusiastic about building projects, exploring new tools, and honing my skills to prepare for a future in software development.

## ðŸš€ Continuous Learning

Currently, I'm expanding my knowledge in web and app development, focusing on areas like frontend design, database management, and UX/UI techniques. I'm eager to see where this journey of discovery and growth takes me!
